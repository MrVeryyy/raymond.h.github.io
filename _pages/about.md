# Summary

- PhD student in Computer Science & Information Management.
- Senior Software Engineer, Researcher, GAN & Latent Space Specialist.  

## About Me

I am a PhD student specializing in computer vision and generative models, with over 10 years of industry experience as a software engineer, developer, and technical leader. My work focuses on latent space analysis, GAN inversion, depth estimation, and controllable image generation.

I currently conduct research on understanding and manipulating latent representations to enable accurate reconstruction, depth inference, and semantic control of visual content using models such as StyleGAN and EG3D.

In parallel with my academic research, I have extensive industry experience in developing large-scale software systems, mobile platforms, and AI-powered applications.

## Research Interests

- Generative Models (GAN, Diffusion Models)
- Latent Space Analysis and Disentanglement
- Depth Estimation using Generative Models
- Image Reconstruction and Inpainting
- Computer Vision and Representation Learning


## Industry Experience

Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Acer, where I led engineering teams, defined scalable architectures, and implemented AI-based image generation systems using StyleGAN. I also designed CI/CD pipelines using Docker, Jenkins, and AWS, and developed cross-platform systems across mobile and web platforms. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

I have also developed Android systems, IoT platforms, and full-stack web applications using Java, Kotlin, Python, C++, React, Spring, and Node.js.


## Academic and Teaching Experience

I served as an Adjunct Lecturer at Soochow University, teaching Data Structures and mentoring students in software engineering and algorithm design. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

My academic work focuses on bridging theoretical research in generative models with practical real-world deployment.
